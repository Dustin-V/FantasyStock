## Install

Before installing, download and install the latest LTS Node.js and Mongodb. You will also need to install nodemon through npx. (Downloading Node.js should install npm/npx, however, if it does not then download those as well)

If this is a new project, make sure to run npm install on both the frontend directory and the backend directory.

You will need to create a '.env. file in the backend directory with all the environment varibles needed for this project.

Now just run 'npm start' in both the backend directory and frontend directory.
