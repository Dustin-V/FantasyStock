# FantasyStock

FantasyStock is made to have fun and easy to use, risk-free experience for our gameâ€™ifed version of the stock market.

## Install

Before installing, download and install the latest LTS Node.js and Mongodb. You will also need to install nodemon through npx. (Downloading Node.js should install npm/npx, however, if it does not then download those as well)

If this is a new project, make sure to run npm install on both the frontend directory and the backend directory.

You will need to create a '.env. file in the backend directory with all the environment varibles needed for this project.
These include: 
DB_HOST
ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
PORT
SESSION_SECERET

For development purposes:
- DB_HOST has to be mongodb://localhost:27017/fantasystock to be ran locally
- ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY will be what is assigned after signing up to Alpha Vantage
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID & GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET will be what is assigned after signing up for Google API https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient the Authorized redirect URIs: http://localhost:5000/register/google/callback
- PORT can be any port, we can use 5000 for this
- SESSION_SECERET can be whatever you want.

Now just run 'npm start' in both the backend directory and frontend directory.
